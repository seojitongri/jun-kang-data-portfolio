### Data

Public dataset containing wage and employment outcomes across cities and time.

### Method

* Difference-in-Differences framework
* Pre vs Post 1980 comparison
* Treatment group: Miami
* Control group: Comparable cities

### Key Findings

* No statistically significant long-term wage decline in Miami relative to control cities
* Results consistent with Card (1990) findings
* Suggests labor markets absorbed immigration shock without large wage disruption

### Skills Demonstrated

* Causal inference
* Difference-in-Differences
* Regression modeling (statsmodels)
* Data cleaning and transformation
* Data visualization
* Reproducible research structure
